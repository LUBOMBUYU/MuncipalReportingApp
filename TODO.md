# Fix Compilation Errors - Progress Summary

## ✅ Resolved Issues:

### 1. CS0246: "The type or namespace name 'Issue' could not be found"
- ✅ Removed duplicate DataStructures.cs file causing namespace conflicts
- ✅ Created Issue.cs in DataStructures folder with proper structure
- ✅ Added Issue.cs to project file
- ✅ Updated all files to use consistent Issue class from MunicipalReportingApp.DataStructures namespace

### 2. CS1729: "'ReportIssues' does not contain a constructor that takes 1 arguments"
- ✅ Updated MainMenuForm.cs to use default ReportIssues constructor instead of passing issuesList
- ✅ The ReportIssues form now uses IssueStorage.Issues for global storage

### 3. CS0103: "The name 'Prompt' does not exist in the current context"
- ✅ Verified Prompt.cs file exists and is accessible
- ✅ The Prompt class is properly defined and should be accessible

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues:

### Build Configuration Issues:
- MSBuild configuration errors related to resource generation tasks
- These are environment/configuration issues, not code syntax errors

## Next Steps:
1. The original C# compilation errors have been resolved
2. The remaining build issues are related to MSBuild/Visual Studio configuration
3. The application logic should now work correctly once the build environment is properly configured
