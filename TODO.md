oa# GMap.NET Integration Plan - Mobile App Adaptation

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Remove GMap.NET.Core package from project
2. [x] Remove GMap.NET.WindowsForms package from project
3. [x] Update MapSelectorForm.Designer.cs to remove WebBrowser control
4. [x] Update MapSelectorForm.cs to remove WebBrowser functionality
5. [x] Prepare for mobile-specific map implementation
6. [ ] Implement mobile-friendly map solution (Xamarin.Forms or other mobile framework)
7. [ ] Test the mobile map functionality

## Current Progress:
- GMap.NET packages have been successfully removed
- WebBrowser control has been removed from the form
- Code has been cleaned up and prepared for mobile implementation
- The application builds successfully
- Next: Implement mobile-specific map solution

## Mobile App Considerations:
- Need to use Xamarin.Forms or MAUI for cross-platform mobile development
- Map control should support touch interactions
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- GPS integration for automatic location detection
- Offline map support (if needed)

## Features to Implement:
- Touch-based location selection
- Mobile-optimized UI/UX
- GPS integration for automatic location detection
- Offline map support (if needed)
